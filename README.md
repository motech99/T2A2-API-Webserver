## R1 Problem and Solution

### Problem

The current state of Pokemon game development presents a challenge for both experienced and novice programmers because of the overwhelming amount of information and complexity involved. The widely used [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) provides a comprehensive dataset including tens of thousands of Pokemon, moves, items, abilities, and other complex details. This extensive amount of information can be overwhelming for developers in two main scenarios: when building new Pokemon games or experiences, and when new to Pokemon game development or programming in general.

For example, a developer named Sergio Perez tried to build a small application to display the original 151 Pokemon. Even for this seemingly simple task, he had to make multiple requests to the PokeAPI to retrieve all the necessary data. This illustrates the challenges developers face when working with such a comprehensive dataset. This article can be found here [Fetching Them All: Poke API](https://medium.com/@sergio13prez/fetching-them-all-poke-api-62ca580981a2)

### Solution

To address this issue, this is where this Pokemon API comes into play. This API provides a wealth of information about Pokemon, such as their types, abilities. It also includes details about trainers' affiliations with gyms. The goal of this API is to make Pokemon game development more accessible to aspiring programmers by presenting a simplified and well-documented interface, thus lowering the barrier to entry for beginners.

This simplified Pokemon API has the potential to lead to faster development and more diverse Pokemon games by reducing development hurdles and attracting new programmers. Ultimately, this API aims to contribute to a more vibrant Pokemon gaming ecosystem by solving the issue of information overload and promoting accessibility.

## R2 Task Allocation and Tracking

All tasks are allocated and tracked through a Trello board. This allows me to visually organise tasks using cards and lists, providing a clear overview of the project's progress. The status of each task is updated as it moves through different stages of completion. Trello's features, such as due dates, labels, and comments, help me manage deadlines and prioritise work.

### This is what it currently looks like as of **20/06/2024**. More features may be added depending on the time

## R4 Database System: Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits and Drawbacks of PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a widely used open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robust features. Below are some of its advantages and disadvantages:

### Advantages

- **Robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** PostgreSQL provides strong support for ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, which is utilised in my application. This simplifies data interaction by enabling the use of Python classes to map to database tables, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **ACID Transactions:** PostgreSQL follows ACID properties for transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency, especially in scenarios with simultaneous database access by multiple users or processes. This is essential for maintaining accurate data in my Pokemon API application.

- **Scalability:** PostgreSQL efficiently handles large datasets and high volumes of concurrent connections, allowing horizontal scaling by adding more servers or vertical scaling by increasing resources on the existing server as a Flask API grows in popularity and user base.

- **Rich Feature Set:** PostgreSQL offers various advanced features, including stored procedures and functions for custom logic, user-defined types (UDTs) tailored to specific application needs, and advanced indexing to enhance query performance.

- **Open-Source and Community-Driven:** Being open-source, PostgreSQL provides significant cost savings compared to restricted database systems. It also benefits from an active and extensive community providing documentation, tutorials, and support.

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve:** While ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy simplify data interaction, understanding relational database concepts and SQL fundamentals is still necessary for effective database management.

- **Complexity for Simple Applications:** For very small-scale applications with basic data needs, PostgreSQL's feature set might be more complex than required, and simpler NoSQL databases might be a better fit.

- **Potential Performance Overhead for Complex Queries:** Complex queries with many joins or aggregations may tax PostgreSQL resources, requiring careful query optimisation in such cases.

- **Potential Challenges in High Availability Configurations:** Setting up high availability with failover capabilities can be more complex with PostgreSQL compared to some managed database services.

## R5 ORM: Features and Functionalities

### Model Definition and Mapping

 **Classes as Tables:** Define database tables as Python classes. Each class attribute directly maps to a column in the corresponding table, creating a natural representation of the data schema.

**Data Types:** ORMs handle data type conversions between Python types, for example, integers or strings and their corresponding database equivalents `INT` or `VARCHAR`

**Relationships:** can define relationships between models, reflecting how data tables are connected in the database, for example, one-to-many or many-to-many. This simplifies working with complex data structures.

```python
class Pokemon(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "pokemons"
    
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100), nullable=False)
    type: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(pokemon_types, nullable=False)
    ability: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100), nullable=False)
    date_caught: Mapped[date] = mapped_column()
    trainer_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("trainers.id"), nullable=True)
    trainer: Mapped["Trainer"] = relationship("Trainer", back_populates="pokemons")
```

#### In this example

`__tablename__` specifies the table name in the database. `Columns id`, `name`, `type`, `ability`, `date_caught`, and `trainer_id` are mapped to corresponding columns in the `Pokemons` table. Relationships (foreign keys) are managed using ForeignKey and relationship.

### Data Validation and Serialization

ORM systems often integrate with libraries such as Marshmallow to handle data validation and serialization, ensuring that data conforms to specified formats before being inserted into the database and when being retrieved.

```python
class PokemonSchema(ma.Schema):
    name = fields.String(
        validate=[
            Regexp("^[a-zA-Z]+$", error="Pokemon name must contain only letters."),
        ],
        required=True,
    )
    trainer = fields.Nested("TrainerSchema", exclude=["password", "admin", "id", "email"], allow_none=True)

    class Meta:
        fields = ("id", "name", "type", "ability", "date_caught", "trainer")
```

#### in this example

The schema validates that the `name` contains only letters.

It also Handles nested relationships, such as the relationship between `Pokemon` and `Trainer`.

### CRUD Operations

ORM offers a simplified interface for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, reducing the need to write complex SQL queries.
For example, adding new trainers and Pokemon.

```python
# Adding new trainers
trainers = [
    Trainer(
        name="Mohammed",
        username="mo123",
        email="mo@email.com",
        password=bcrypt.generate_password_hash("potatoismyfav123").decode("utf-8"),
        admin=True,
        team="Mystic",
    ),
    Trainer(
        name="John",
        username="John045",
        email="johnno@email.com",
        password=bcrypt.generate_password_hash("johnisnotmyname321").decode("utf-8"),
        team="Valor",
    ),
]
db.session.add_all(trainers)
db.session.commit()

# Adding new Pokemon
pokemons = [
    Pokemon(
        name="Squirtle",
        type="Water",
        ability="Torrent",
        date_caught=date.today(),
        trainer=trainers[0],
    ),
    Pokemon(
        name="Charmander",
        type="Fire",
        ability="Blaze",
        date_caught=date(2024, 1, 14),
        trainer=trainers[1],
    ),
    ]
db.session.add_all(pokemons)
db.session.commit()
```

These examples demonstrate the ease of adding records to the database using the ORM's session management and commit functions.

## R6 Models and Relationships

![1](./docs/pokemon-ERD.png)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) offers a clear visual representation of the database structure, making it easier to understand the relationships between different entities. It helps organize the data in a structured manner, ensuring that all necessary entities and their attributes are accounted for.

### The database consists of two main tables

### Pokemon

- **Attributes:** Pokemon_Id (PK), name, type, ability, date_caught, trainer_id (FK)
- **Description:** The Pokemon table contains information about each Pokemon.
- **Primary Key:** Pokemon_id uniquely identifies each Pokemon
- **Foriegn Key:** trainer_id references the trainer_id in the trainers table.

### Trainers

- **Attributes:** Trainer_ID (PK), name, username, email, password, gym, admin
- **Description:** The Trainers table stores information about each trainer, including their credentials for authentication and their affiliation with a specific gym.
- **Primary Key:** Trainer_ID uniquely identifies each trainer.
- **Foreign Key:** gym_id references Gym_id in the Gyms table.

### Benefits of the ERD in Database Design

#### Clarity and Planning

**Visualisation:** The ERD provides a clear visual representation of the database structure, making it easier to understand the relationships between different entities.

**Organisation:** It helps organise the data in a structured manner, ensuring that all necessary entities and their attributes are accounted for.

#### Normalisation

**Avoiding Redundancy:** The ERD helps in normalising the database by eliminating redundant data. For example, moves are stored separately in the Moves table and linked to Pokemon through the Pokemon_Moves table.

**Data Integrity:** Ensures that data is stored in only one place, reducing the chances of data anomalies and maintaining consistency.

#### Defining Relationships

**Foreign Keys:** The use of foreign keys (FK) enforces referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables are maintained correctly. For instance, Pokemon_Id in Pokemon_Moves must match a valid Pokemon_Id in the Pokemon table.

**Relationships:** Clearly defines how entities relate to each other (one-to-many, many-to-many), aiding in the correct implementation of business rules. For example, the many-to-many relationship between Pokemon and Moves allows for flexibility in assigning moves to Pokemon.
