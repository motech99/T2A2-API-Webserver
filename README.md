## R1 Problem and Solution

### Problem

The current state of Pokemon game development presents a challenge for both experienced and novice programmers because of the overwhelming amount of information and complexity involved. The widely used [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) provides a comprehensive dataset including tens of thousands of Pokemon, moves, items, abilities, and other complex details. This extensive amount of information can be overwhelming for developers in two main scenarios: when building new Pokemon games or experiences, and when new to Pokemon game development or programming in general.

For example, a developer named Sergio Perez tried to build a small application to display the original 151 Pokemon. Even for this seemingly simple task, he had to make multiple requests to the PokeAPI to retrieve all the necessary data. This illustrates the challenges developers face when working with such a comprehensive dataset.

### Solution

To address this issue, this is where this Pokemon API comes into play. This API provides a wealth of information about Pokemon, such as their types, abilities, and evolutions. It also includes details about trainers' affiliations with gyms and evolution chains. The goal of this API is to make Pokemon game development more accessible to aspiring programmers by presenting a simplified and well-documented interface, thus lowering the barrier to entry for beginners.

This simplified Pokemon API has the potential to lead to faster development and more diverse Pokemon games by reducing development hurdles and attracting new programmers. Ultimately, this API aims to contribute to a more vibrant Pokemon gaming ecosystem by solving the issue of information overload and promoting accessibility.

## R2 Task Allocation and Tracking

All tasks are allocated and tracked through a Trello board. This allows me to visually organise tasks using cards and lists, providing a clear overview of the project's progress. The status of each task is updated as it moves through different stages of completion. Trello's features, such as due dates, labels, and comments, help me manage deadlines and prioritise work.

### This is what it currently looks like as of **20/06/2024**. More features may be added depending on the time
